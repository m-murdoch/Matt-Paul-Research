The syntax 
setParallel(prog, system, "", "0,1,2");
was used where the numbes in the 4th argument may varry. 
The 4th argument constitutes which dimensions should be parallelized. 


Valid 4th arguments that generate code successfully are:
"0,1,2", "0,1", "1,2", "0,2" (same as 0,1,2), "2" (same as 1,2), "1", "0".

In order to use the pragmas, the makefile must be regenerated by AlphaZ
as the setParallel() call changes how the executable will be made.

Can set number of threads in the program or before running in the terminal.

See if the number of threads is set in the program.

Need to use icc, so find out how to make icc recognize OpenMP.
