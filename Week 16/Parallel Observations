The syntax 
setParallel(prog, system, "", "0,1,2");
was used where the numbes in the 4th argument may varry. 
The 4th argument constitutes which dimensions should be parallelized. 


Valid 4th arguments that generate code successfully are:
"0,1,2", "0,1", "1,2", "0,2" (same as 0,1,2), "2" (same as 1,2), "1", "0".
