export PATH=$PATH:/s/chopin/e/proj/PARRIC-REU/intel/bin

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/s/parsons/l/sys/intel_2018/mkl/lib/intel64:/s/parsons/l/sys/intel_2018/lib/intel64:

export INTEL_LICENSE_FILE=/s/chopin/e/proj/PARRIC-REU/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2019.0.117/linux/Licenses/NCOM_L___S4ZD-V2FJKCCS.lic

2.) The application is located in (UPDATED 9/13/19) 
	Louis Narmour fixed internal error problems by completely reinstalling Intel Advisor

Notes for Use:

1.)	Create a new project and check it will be saved where you want it.
  a.	Skip to “Create”
  
2.)	A binary file is required – browse to the executable file you want to test and select it (for out case, the “OSP” executable). 

3.)	Application Parameters are required command line arguments (for our case, the variable N is required – for instance 1000).

4.)	(UPDATED) First run survey, then Trip Counts and FLOPS with both options selected, then roofline. 
  	Many points are displayed - green, yellow, and red in the order of importance and time consumed from least to greatest,
  	and increasing size also for importance and time consumed.
  
5.)	Observe the “Summary”

6.)	Click “Survey” in a bar on the left to observe more. 

7.)	Manual compilation with the “-g” flag adds more information to the “survey” and “summary” such as what specific 
  	segments of code link to each dot displayed.
