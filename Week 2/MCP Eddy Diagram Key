Eddy Diagrams for the matrix-chain product problem:

-The horizontal axis represents the matrix-chain. 
-A solid arc indicates a parentesization of the matrices within the arc. 
-A dashed arc indicates the possibility, yet undecided, of a parenthesization of the matrices within the arc.
-A dotted arc indicates that a parenthesization will not be made here. 
-White space within the scope of the problem indicates uncertainty until more of the choice costs are memoized.
-Grey shading indicates the smallest parenthesization possible. No arcs of any kind will cross this area. 
-Cyan shading indicates that the problem is solved in this area. The decision has been made that this area will 
be included in a parenthesization or not. 

As the table of parenthesization costs is populated in a bottom up fashion, the certainty of the Eddy diagram increases.
