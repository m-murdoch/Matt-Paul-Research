This is a list of theoretical parallel mappings - taking the implementation produced as is despite
it not matching what I thouht it would do from the loop depth argument.

This list is incomplete/ in progress:

d_-k_j: 
d_-k_-j: 
j_-k_-i: 
j_-k_d: 
j_-k_i: 
d_k_-j: 
d_k_j: 
d_-j_-k: 
d_j_-k: innermost and middle
-i_j_-k: 
-i_j: 
d_j: 
d_-j: 
d_j_k: innermost and middle (Passed for both)
j_-i:  
j_d_-k: 
j_-i_-k: 
d_-j_k: 
-i_j_k: 
j_d_k:
j_-i_k: 
-i_k_-j: innermost (Passed)
-i_k_j: innermost (Should work but does not pass - seems parallelized incorrectly)
